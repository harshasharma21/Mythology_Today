           <p>Barbarika/ Belarsen was a grandson of Bhima (second of the Pandava brothers), and the son of Ghatotkacha. Ghatotkacha was the son of Bhima and Hidimbi. Even in his childhood, Barbarika was a very brave warrior. He learnt the art of warfare from his mother. The gods (ashtadeva) gave him the three infallible arrows.[7] Hence, Barbarika came to be known as "Bearer of Three Arrows". When Barbarika learnt that the battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas had become inevitable, he wanted to witness what was to be the Mahābhārata War. He promised his mother that if he felt the urge to participate in the battle, he would join the side that would be losing. He rode to the field on his blue horse, equipped with his three arrows and bow.</p>

<p>According to folklore, before the Kurukshetra War began, Krishna asked all the warriors how many days it would take to finish the Mahabharata war alone. Bhishma answered that he would take 20 days to finish the war. Dronacharya replied that it would take him 25 days. When Karna was asked, he said he would take 24 days. Arjuna told Krishna it would take 28 days for him to complete the battle by himself. In this manner, Krishna asked each warrior and received an answer.[citation needed]

    Krishna, disguised as a Brahmin, stopped Barbarika to examine his strength. When asked how many days he would take to finish the war alone, Barbarika answered that he could finish it in one minute. Krishna then asked Barbarika how he would finish the great battle with just three arrows. Barbarika replied that a single arrow was enough to destroy all his opponents in the war, and it would then return to his quiver. He stated that the first arrow is used to mark all the things that he wants to destroy. If he uses the second arrow, then the second arrow will mark all the things that he wants to save. On using the third arrow, it will destroy all the things that are marked and then return to his quiver. In other words, with one arrow he can fix all his targets and with the other, he can destroy them.</p>

<p>Krishna then challenged him to tie all the leaves of the peepal tree under which he was standing, using his arrows. Barbarika accepted the challenge and started meditating to release his arrow by closing his eyes. As Barbarika started meditating, Krishna quietly plucked a leaf from the tree and hid it under his foot. When Barbarika released his first arrow, it marked all the leaves of the tree and finally started hovering around the leg of Krishna. Krishna asked Barbarika why the arrow was hovering over his foot. Barbarika replied that there must be a leaf under his foot and the arrow was targeting his foot to mark the leaf that was hidden underneath. Barbarika advised Krishna to lift his leg, since otherwise the arrow would mark the leaf by piercing Krishna's foot. Krishna then lifted his foot and the first arrow also marked the hidden leaf. The third arrow then collected all the leaves (including the hidden leaf ) and tied them together. By this, Krishna concluded that the arrows were so powerful and infallible, that even if Barbarika was unaware of the whereabouts of his targets, his arrows could still navigate and trace his intended targets. Thus, Krishna gets a deeper insight into Barbarika's phenomenal power.</p>

<p>Sri Krishna was amazing wasn't he???......Well, let me know......</p>
