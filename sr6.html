       <h2 class="text-center">How did Dashaanan become Raavan?</h2>
       <hr>
       
       <h5>
           <p>Lord Shiva had many ardent devotees such as, Nandi,Sage Dhadichi and Lord Ram as well.Of all these countless devotees Lord Shiva proclaimed Dashaanan to be his favourite.Because Dashaanan was different,he was prepared to undergo any sacrifice for his lord and had pure devotion for him.But soon his devotion was turning into ego(ahankaar) and due to his strength,this ego multiplied.Then,Dashaanan had an idea which would eventually teach him a lesson of modesty and true devotion by the Lord himself.</p>
           <p>
              Dashaanan sat meditating furiously in the name of Shiva.He sat for days without eating or drinking only uttering shiva's name.Finally,one day he woke up from his penance.All his courtiers and family members were very curious to know why he was meditating.Dashaanan finaly revealed his idea,"He wanted to bring Lord Shiva to lanka".
           </p>
           <p>
               That was a ridiculous idea.Everyone tried to keep out of this hilarious and dangerous idea but Dashaanan paid heed to none.He then travelled to 'Alka-puri',the city of his brother,'Kubera'.
               Kubera invited Dashaanan and asked him the reason for his visit.Dashaanan replied that he wanted to borro his 'Pushpak-Viman'(Flying chariot) to travel to some place.Kubera formally asked Dashaanan the place he wished to visit.When dashaanan replied he wanted to visit 'Kailash',Kubera burst out laughing as the chariot is man-made and hence it wont fly on Kailash.
           </p>
           <p>
               Dashaanan replied saying that he being Lord Shiva's greatest devotee it would fly and thus boarded the chariot and head towards kailash.Just as Kubera said,the chariot lost balance and fell down from the sky in the proximity of Kailash.Dashaanan climbed out of the wrecked chariot unharmed and straight ahead he could see the enormous Kailash mountain.He decided to continue the rest of the journey through foot.
           </p>
           <p>
               On the other hand,Lord Shiva could feel Dashaanan's presence already on Kailash.He knew that dashaanan was not here on a good purpose and decided to teach him a lesson.Meanwhile ,Dashaanan reached the Kailash mountain,on whose uptop Lord Shiva resides along with his family.
           </p>
           <p>
               Now,the question was how is Dashaanan going to bring Lord Shiva to lanka.The penance dashaanan did previously was answer to this question.Through that penance, he gained enormous powers and became so powerful so as to lift the entire 'Kailash Mountain' with his bare hands.Thus, he would carry the entire mountain to lanka and serve shiva.
           </p>
           <p>
               So,Dashaanan bent down,slid his hands under the huge mountain and with his all might lifted it straight up!He did it, he actually lifted the 'Kailash Mountain'(This lifting is inferenced several times later in Ramayana and also becomes a main reson for Ravan's arrogance and ego).Mount Kailash vibrated due to the left.Lord Shiva had to control the situation now.Thus,he place the thumb of his right foot on the mountain and pressed it downwards.
           </p>
           <p>
               The effect of Shiva's thumb was too much and the mountain started sliding down and restored to its original place, crushing Dashaanan's hands under it.Due to the extruciating pain, dashaanan led out a cry, so powerful that all the three worlds heard it.The gods,raakshasaas were all in a sense of curiosity as to who uttered the cry.
           </p>
           <p>
               Now,Nandi who was nearby heard the cry and came running towards Dashaanan.Nandi's heart melt at the sight of Dashaanan and thought of helping a fellow shiva-devotee.Nandi advised dashaanan to impress lord Shiva with his musical talent.Thus,Dashaanan then let out a beautiful song describing shiva's greatness(Shiva Tandava Stotram).
           </p>
           <p>
               Pleased with his devotion,Lord shiva let go of his thumb from the mountain and thus freeing Dashaanan's hands.His hands were totally crushed due to the mountains might.Then,lord shiva appeared infront of Dashaanan ,curing his hands.
           </p>
           <p>
               Shiva was greatly disappointed with his act and said that neither devotion nor strength can move kailash,The heart of my devotee is itself a Kailash.Thus Shiva taught him a lesson of devotion to crush Dashaanan's arrogance and ego.
           </p>
           <p>
               Then Shiva game Dashaanan a new name , "Ravana".Dashaanan was highly impressed with his new name.Also,impressed with his musical talent, shiva said that the song would be known as the "Shiva Tandava Stotram" and whoever in need utters this stotram i will be there to aid him.
           </p>
           <p>
               Shiva then gifted his 'Crescent-shaped sword',"Chandrahaas" to Ravana, which was invincible in battle and asked Ravana to use it for good and helpful purposes.
           </p>
           
           <p>
